# MetaTrace: Web-Based Metadata Forensics & Analysis Tool

## 🔍 Overview
MetaTrace is a **web-based metadata extraction and analysis platform** that integrates **FastAPI and ExifTool** to extract metadata from uploaded files. It employs an **Isolation Forest model** for tampering detection and **Groq AI** for intelligent metadata analysis and best-practice recommendations. To enhance security and transparency, the platform leverages **Moonbase blockchain** for secure storage.

## 🚀 Features
- **Extract metadata** from images, documents, and files
- **Analyze metadata** using AI for deeper insights
- **Detect tampering** using the Isolation Forest model
- **Secure storage** on blockchain for transparency
- **User options** to copy, download, or delete past uploads
- **Interactive UI** for ease of use

## 📌 Future Improvements
